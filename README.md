# SI507 Final Project
Author: Ziyue Zhou (zyzhou)

Required packages: sqlite3, plotly, bs4

Simply run final_zyzhou.py. The program should be able to build a database,
and then throws a user menu:
**********************************************************
Select one of the following options:
1. choose a city to view statistics for each type of crime
2. choose a city and a crime type to view its trend
3. view summary of all crime events for each city
4. choose a crime type to view its summary for each city
**********************************************************

As the user enters 1, 2, 3 or 4, the program will create corresponding figures.
The user may also enter "exit" to end the program.
[Note] Some choices may further ask the user to enter city name or crime type.

Thank you.
